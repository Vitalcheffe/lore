// ─── FAQ DATA ────────────────────────────────────────────
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Is ClearPath AI free to use?',
    answer:
      'Yes, ClearPath AI is completely free for individuals. Our core mission is making community resources accessible to everyone. The Free tier gives you unlimited searches, crisis detection, confidence scores, and access to 211 human navigators — forever. Pro and Enterprise plans are for power users and organizations who need advanced features.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes ClearPath different from ChatGPT?',
    answer:
      'Unlike generic AI chatbots, ClearPath AI never hallucinates resources. We classify against a verified 211 database using BART-large-MNLI, show calibrated confidence scores on every result, and bypass AI entirely when crisis keywords are detected. Every result shows WHY it was recommended, WHAT ELSE was considered, and HOW CONFIDENT we are.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does crisis detection work?',
    answer:
      'Before any AI processing, we check every input against hardcoded crisis keywords. If detected, the AI layer is bypassed entirely and you\'re immediately connected to crisis resources like the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. This isn\'t a probability — it\'s a deterministic safety layer that always activates, even on the Free plan.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data stored?',
    answer:
      'No. ClearPath AI does not store any conversation data, ever. Your searches and conversations are processed in real-time and immediately discarded. We believe that people seeking community resources deserve absolute privacy. This is true across all plans — Free, Pro, and Enterprise. On Pro and Enterprise, your saved conversation history is stored locally on your device and never on our servers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I switch between plans?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time from your account settings. When upgrading, you\'ll get immediate access to Pro features and be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of your billing cycle. When downgrading, your Pro features remain active until the end of your current billing period. There are no cancellation fees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does annual billing work?',
    answer:
      'Annual billing gives you 12 months of access at a 25% discount compared to monthly billing. For Pro, that\'s $9/month billed annually ($108/year) instead of $12/month. You can switch between monthly and annual billing at any time. If you switch from annual to monthly, the change takes effect at the end of your current annual period.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer discounts for nonprofits?',
    answer:
      'Yes! We offer a 50% discount on the Pro plan for verified nonprofit organizations. That means Pro is just $6/month (or $4.50/month on annual billing) for nonprofits. We believe in supporting the people who support communities. Contact our team with proof of your nonprofit status, and we\'ll apply the discount to your account within 24 hours. Enterprise plans for nonprofits also receive special pricing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to my saved history if I downgrade?',
    answer:
      'If you downgrade from Pro to Free, your saved conversation history remains accessible in read-only mode for 30 days. After that, the saved data is permanently removed. We recommend exporting your history before downgrading. You can always upgrade again to regain the saved history feature.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the API rate limits for Enterprise?',
    answer:
      'Enterprise API access starts at 10,000 requests per month with burst capacity up to 100 requests per minute. Higher limits are available upon request. All API requests include classification results, confidence scores, and crisis detection flags. Rate limit monitoring and usage dashboards are included.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What white-label options are available?',
    answer:
      'Enterprise customers can fully customize the ClearPath AI interface: custom logo, brand colors, custom domain (e.g., resources.yourorg.org), tailored onboarding flows, and custom classification categories. We provide a design system and implementation support to ensure the white-labeled experience matches your organization\'s brand guidelines.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use ClearPath AI for my team or organization?',
    answer:
      'Yes! While the Free plan is designed for individual use, Pro accounts can be used by individual practitioners (social workers, counselors, etc.). For teams and organizations, our Enterprise plan includes team management, shared resource databases, centralized billing, and organizational dashboards. Contact our sales team for team-specific pricing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is your refund policy?',
    answer:
      'We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If ClearPath AI doesn\'t meet your expectations within the first 30 days, we\'ll refund your payment in full — no questions asked. After 30 days, you can cancel anytime and your plan remains active until the end of the current billing period. We do not offer partial refunds for unused time after the 30-day guarantee period.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I request a new feature?',
    answer:
      'We love hearing from our users! You can submit feature requests through the feedback button in the app, by emailing team@clearpath-ai.org, or through our community forum. Pro and Enterprise users get priority consideration for feature requests. We review all suggestions monthly and publish a public roadmap of planned features.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is ClearPath AI HIPAA compliant?',
    answer:
      'ClearPath AI does not store Protected Health Information (PHI) and processes all data in real-time with zero retention. While this zero-storage architecture inherently supports HIPAA compliance, we are working toward formal HIPAA BAA availability for Enterprise customers. Contact our sales team for the latest compliance status and timeline.',
