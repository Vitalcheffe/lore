            When vulnerable people seek help with food, housing, or mental health, an AI that
            confidently directs them to a non-existent program doesn&apos;t just waste time — it
            erodes trust in the entire help-seeking process. Our Responsible AI Framework is not an
            afterthought. It is the architectural foundation of the system.

              Every AI system has failure modes. The responsible approach is not to pretend they don&apos;t
              exist — it&apos;s to name them, assess them, and build mitigations for each one. Here are the

              These limitations are not weaknesses in our Responsible AI framework — they are strengths.
              A team that cannot articulate its system&apos;s limitations has not thought deeply enough about
              responsible deployment. We believe honesty about what we cannot do is as important as
              demonstrating what we can.
