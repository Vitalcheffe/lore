    question: 'How do I report a bug or incorrect resource?',
    answer: 'Use our contact form and select "Bug Report" as the subject. Include as much detail as possible — the resource name, what was incorrect, and any screenshots. Our resource verification team reviews all reports within 24 hours and will update the database if the information is inaccurate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my communication with ClearPath AI confidential?',
    answer: 'Yes. All communications are encrypted in transit and at rest. We never share your personal information with third parties. Crisis-related communications follow additional HIPAA-adjacent protocols. You can read our full privacy policy at /privacy.',

  },
  {
    question: 'How do I request a feature or improvement?',
    answer: 'The best way is to open an issue on our GitHub repository at github.com/Vitalcheffe/clearpath-ai. This allows community discussion and tracking. Alternatively, use the contact form with "Feature Request" as the subject and describe your feature request in detail.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are your support hours?',
    answer: 'Our crisis escalation pathway operates 24/7 through 988 and 211. Email support is available Monday through Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM ET.

  },
  {
    question: 'Is ClearPath AI free to use?',
    answer: 'The core resource navigator is and will remain free for individuals. Organizations requiring API access, custom integrations, or dedicated support can explore our pricing plans at /pricing. We believe access to community resources should never be paywalled.',

                    Our team spans multiple time zones and countries, united by one belief: AI systems that
                    interact with people in crisis must be transparent about what they know and don&apos;t know.
                    We&apos;re competing in the <span className="font-semibold text-gray-700">USAII Global AI Hackathon 2026</span> to
                    prove that responsible AI is not just a theory — it&apos;s a working, testable, auditable system.
