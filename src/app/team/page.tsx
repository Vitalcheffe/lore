    desc: 'Our founder Amine witnessed firsthand how people in his community struggled to find social services — outdated websites, hours-long phone waits, and AI chatbots that hallucinated resources with false confidence. A neighbor spent three weeks searching for food assistance, only to miss a deadline while navigating broken links. The problem was clear: when people need help most, the system fails them. ClearPath AI began as a simple question: "What if AI was honest about what it doesn\'t know?"',

    title: 'First Prototype',
    desc: 'With the vision of calibrated transparency defined, Amine built the first working prototype in two weeks. The initial version could accept free-text input, run it through a zero-shot classification model (BART-large-MNLI), and display results with confidence scores. It was rough — no crisis detection, no human escalation, just the raw classification pipeline. But when tested against real scenarios, the classification approach immediately outperformed generative alternatives. Zero hallucinated resources. Zero phantom phone numbers. The proof of concept worked.',

    month: 'March 2026',
    title: 'Crisis Detection Layer',
    desc: 'Safety became non-negotiable in March. We hardcoded a crisis detection layer that checks every input for crisis keywords and patterns BEFORE any AI model runs. If a crisis is detected, the classification pipeline is bypassed entirely and the user is connected directly to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. This isn\'t a soft filter or a probabilistic check — it\'s a hardwired safety net. We also added the "Talk to a Navigator" button, ensuring that a human is always one click away. Safety by design, not by afterthought.',

This partnership gave ClearPath AI access to 50,000+ verified resources across all 50 states, each with source attribution and last-verified dates. No more hallucinated resources. No more broken links. Every resource card now shows exactly where the data came from and when it was last checked. Trust requires verifiability.',

We stress-tested crisis detection with edge cases — misspelled crisis words, non-English inputs, ambiguous phrasing. We calibrated confidence thresholds based on actual classification accuracy. Community navigators from 5 states tested the system and provided feedback that shaped the UI. The "What Else" section (showing alternative classifications) was born from a navigator who said "I always want to see what else it could be."',

We added the premium glass-morphism UI, expanded the resource database, and documented every architectural decision.

                      We never deploy on Fridays. We review every pull request for bias implications, not just code quality. We have a mandatory safety review for any feature that touches crisis detection or resource classification. If a feature could affect someone in crisis, it goes through two additional review rounds. Speed matters, but safety matters more.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-[14px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
                      Our incident response process is modeled after hospital triage — the most critical issues (anything affecting crisis detection) are treated as P0 and resolved within the hour. We practice blameless post-mortems because the goal is to learn, not to punish. When a bug slipped through our crisis detection test suite in April, we didn&apos;t point fingers — we added 50 new test cases and published a transparent incident report.

                      We practice internally what we build externally. Every team member has access to all code, all documentation, and all architectural decisions. Our weekly standups are public. Our roadmap is visible to everyone on the team. When we make mistakes, we document them openly. We believe that transparency isn&apos;t just a product feature — it&apos;s a team practice.

                      Our decision-making process follows a "written proposal → public comment → decision" model inspired by RFC processes at Google and Amazon. Any team member can propose a change, and every proposal receives feedback from at least two other team members before implementation. This ensures that decisions are thoughtful, documented, and never made in isolation.

                      Every product decision begins with a community navigator. We don&apos;t build features because they&apos;re technically interesting — we build them because a real person in a real community needs them. Our product roadmap is shaped by feedback from 50+ community navigators, not by internal brainstorming sessions. When a navigator told us "I always want to see what else it could be," we built the "What Else" section within 48 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-[14px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
                      We conduct monthly "Navigator Sessions" where community navigators use the product live and share their screen while we watch. These sessions have revealed bugs we never would have found in testing — like the fact that our crisis keyword list didn&apos;t include the phrase "I can&apos;t go on," which a navigator flagged after a real caller used those exact words. That keyword was added within the hour.

                      Our zero-data-storage architecture isn&apos;t just a technical decision — it&apos;s a cultural commitment. We don&apos;t store user data because we believe that the people who need community resources the most are often the most vulnerable to surveillance. Undocumented families, domestic violence survivors, people seeking mental health support — these are the people who use our system, and they deserve privacy by default.

                      This commitment extends to our internal tools too. We don&apos;t track team member productivity with keyloggers or screenshot tools. We don&apos;t require time tracking. We trust our team to manage their own time and deliver results. If you need to take a mental health day, you take it — no questions asked. The same privacy we extend to our users, we extend to each other.

                      We allocate 10% of every sprint to learning — whether that&apos;s reading papers on NLI calibration, studying accessibility guidelines, or shadowing a community navigator for a day. Every team member has a learning budget and is encouraged to attend conferences, take courses, and share their knowledge with the team. Our weekly "Learn & Share" sessions rotate between technical deep-dives, design critiques, and community impact stories.

                      We also learn from our mistakes — publicly. Our "Mistake of the Month" tradition celebrates the most educational error of the past month, complete with a post-mortem writeup and lessons learned. The only rule: the mistake must teach us something new. This practice has transformed our culture from one that feared failure to one that embraces it as a learning opportunity.

Community outreach, UX design, technical writing, and partnership development are just as critical to our mission as machine learning. We believe diverse perspectives build better AI.',

No databases, no session logs, no cookies. We can\'t breach what we don\'t store, and we can\'t misuse data we never collect. This was a founding principle, not an afterthought.',

                  a: 'It means our AI always shows its confidence level. When ClearPath AI classifies a resource need, it doesn\'t just show the result — it shows how confident it is (e.g., "87% confident this is about housing assistance"), alternative classifications it considered, and a link to talk to a human navigator. The AI tells you what it knows, what it doesn\'t know, and how sure it is.',

                  a: 'Crisis detection is a hardcoded layer that runs BEFORE any AI model touches your input. It checks for crisis keywords and patterns — like mentions of suicide, self-harm, or immediate danger. If a crisis is detected, the AI classification is bypassed entirely and the user is connected directly to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. This is not a probabilistic filter — it\'s a hardwired safety net.',

ClearPath AI classifies against a verified database of 50,000+ real resources. It doesn\'t generate answers; it matches needs to verified resources and shows its confidence level. If it\'s not sure, it says so — and connects you to a human. Classified, not generated.',

                    Six months ago, our founder Amine watched a neighbor spend three weeks searching for food assistance — navigating broken links, calling disconnected numbers, and eventually missing a deadline because the system was designed for bureaucrats, not for people. That moment sparked a question that became our founding principle: <span className="font-semibold text-gray-700">What if AI was honest about what it doesn&apos;t know?</span>
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[14px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
                    Two weeks later, the first prototype was running — a simple classification pipeline that matched free-text descriptions of needs against a resource taxonomy, displaying confidence scores for each match. No hallucinated phone numbers. No phantom programs. Just honest, calibrated results. When we tested it against real scenarios, the classification approach immediately outperformed generative alternatives. Zero fabricated resources. Zero false confidence.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[14px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
                    Over the next four months, we added crisis detection (a hardcoded layer that bypasses AI entirely when crisis keywords are detected), brokered a data partnership with United Way 211 (giving us access to 50,000+ verified resources), and conducted beta testing with over 50 community navigators across 5 states. Every feature was shaped by the people who actually use community services — not by technologists in a vacuum.
