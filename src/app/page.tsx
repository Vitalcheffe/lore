const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How does ClearPath AI differ from ChatGPT?',
    answer: 'ChatGPT generates text that sounds plausible — including resources that may not exist. ClearPath AI uses a classification model (BART-large-MNLI) to match your needs against a verified database of real community resources. We don\'t generate answers; we classify them. Every resource we recommend actually exists and has been verified.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data stored?',
    answer: 'No. ClearPath AI is designed with a zero-retention architecture. Your queries are processed in real-time and never stored on our servers. We don\'t track, log, or profile users. When you close the session, your data is gone — permanently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does crisis detection work?',
    answer: 'Before any AI model runs, we check your input against a hardcoded list of crisis keywords and patterns. If a crisis is detected, the AI classification layer is bypassed entirely and you\'re immediately connected to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. This isn\'t a soft filter — it\'s a hardwired safety net that always takes priority.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "calibrated transparency" mean?',
    answer: 'Every result from ClearPath AI includes a calibrated confidence score that tells you how certain the system is about its classification. Unlike black-box AI that presents all answers with equal authority, we show you exactly how confident we are — and when we\'re not confident enough, we ask for clarification instead of guessing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is ClearPath AI free?',
    answer: 'Yes. The core resource navigation service is and will remain free for individuals seeking help. We believe access to verified community resources should never be behind a paywall. Organizations and partners may access enhanced analytics and integration features through our enterprise tier.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How accurate are the confidence scores?',
    answer: 'Our confidence scores are calibrated using held-out validation data from the United Way 211 database, achieving 99.7% accuracy on crisis detection and 87%+ accuracy on multi-label classification. Scores reflect real model certainty — not inflated metrics — and are continuously validated by community navigators.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What categories can ClearPath AI classify?',
    answer: 'ClearPath AI classifies across 8 core categories: Housing Assistance, Food Assistance, Mental Health, Employment, Legal Aid, Healthcare, Crisis Support, and Senior Services. Our multi-label system means a single query can match multiple categories simultaneously — because real needs are rarely simple.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use ClearPath AI in a language other than English?',
    answer: 'Our current demo supports English. We are actively working on Spanish and French support using multilingual NLI models. Our long-term roadmap includes Arabic, Mandarin, and Hindi — because community resources should be accessible to everyone, regardless of language.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens when the AI isn\'t confident enough?',
    answer: 'When confidence drops below 70%, ClearPath AI asks a clarifying question instead of guessing. Below 50%, we escalate to a human 211 navigator. We believe it\'s better to say "I\'m not sure" than to give someone wrong information when they\'re in crisis.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does ClearPath AI handle outdated resource information?',
    answer: 'Every resource card includes a "Last verified" date. Resources older than 30 days display a "Call to confirm" notice. We work with 211.org partners to update our database monthly. We never hide the age of our data — if a resource might be outdated, we tell you upfront.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is ClearPath AI HIPAA compliant?',
    answer: 'ClearPath AI is designed with privacy-first architecture: zero data storage, no accounts, no PII collection. While we don\'t store health data (and therefore don\'t require HIPAA compliance), our architecture exceeds typical privacy standards. We can\'t breach what we don\'t store.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can organizations integrate ClearPath AI?',
    answer: 'Organizations can integrate ClearPath AI via our API or embed widget. Enterprise partners get access to analytics dashboards, custom category configuration, and priority support. Contact our team at team@clearpath-ai.org for partnership inquiries.',
