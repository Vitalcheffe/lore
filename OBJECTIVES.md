# CLEARPATH AI — PROJECT OBJECTIVES

**We are not building a hackathon demo. We are building a product people would trust with their life.**

---

## 🔴 LEVEL 0 — NON-NEGOTIABLE BASELINE

If we don't hit these, we don't submit. Period.

- **The app loads in under 3 seconds** on a 3G connection. A person in crisis does not wait.
- **Crisis detection fires within 200ms** of input. If someone types "I want to hurt myself," they see the 988 hotline BEFORE any AI classification runs. No exceptions. No loading spinners. Instant.
- **Every single result shows a confidence score.** If we ever display a resource without telling the user how confident the AI is, that's a bug, not a feature gap.
- **The app works on a $50 Android phone.** Our users are not on iPhone 15 Pro. They are on cracked screens with slow data. If it doesn't work on their device, it doesn't work.
- **Zero data stored without explicit consent.** The user types their problem, we process it, we show results, we forget. No database of people's crises.
- **A real person can take over at any point.** The "Talk to a navigator" button is not a future feature. It's live on day one. It connects to 211.

## 🟡 LEVEL 1 — COMPETITIVE STANDARD

This is what a Top 3 project looks like. Anything below this is mid.

- **The user describes their situation in one sentence and gets three things:** (1) What the AI thinks they need, (2) How confident it is, (3) What else it considered. No clicking through menus. No dropdowns. One sentence in, full picture out.
- **When the AI is unsure, it doesn't guess — it asks.** "You mentioned rent problems. Have you received an eviction notice?" One question, typed naturally, and the confidence jumps from 52% to 94%. That moment IS the product.
- **The pitch video makes the judge feel something.** Not a screen recording with voiceover. A 2-minute story: a real scenario, a real wrong answer from a search engine, and then ClearPath doing it right. The judge should think "this team understands what's at stake."
- **The GitHub repo looks like a real startup.** Clean README with architecture diagram. CONTRIBUTING.md. RESPONSIBLE_AI.md. Not 47 files dumped in root. Not "will clean up later." Professional from commit one.
- **The deployed app is accessible by anyone with the URL.** No "it works on my machine." No localhost. The judge clicks the link and it works. Every time.
- **The confidence score isn't just a number — it's an experience.** A 94% match feels different from a 52% match. The UI makes that distinction visceral. Color, size, language — everything communicates certainty vs uncertainty.
- **Our Devpost page reads like a startup pitch, not a homework submission.** Problem statement that punches you in the gut. Architecture that makes sense. Limitations we're honest about. Impact that's measurable.

## 🟢 LEVEL 2 — JAW-DROPPER

This is what wins the whole thing. This is the level where a judge puts down their pen and says "this is the one."

- **The AI explains itself like a human would.** Not "Legal Aid — 78% confidence." But "I think you might need legal aid because you mentioned eviction. I'm fairly confident about this, but there's also a chance you need emergency financial assistance. Want to tell me more?" That explanation IS the transparency. It's not a separate section. It's woven into the answer.
- **A judge can break it and it still behaves responsibly.** They type nonsense. They type in another language. They type something triggering. In EVERY case: crisis keywords are caught, low confidence triggers clarification, and nothing harmful is presented as certain. The system is antifragile in its ethics.
- **The clarification questions feel like a conversation, not a form.** Not a dropdown of 5 options. A natural follow-up: "You said you can't pay rent — is this because of a job loss, or did you get a notice from your landlord?" Each question narrows the confidence gap.
- **The demo flow is rehearsed and airtight.** We have 3 demo scenarios: (1) A clear-cut case where the AI is confident, (2) A tricky case where it asks clarification, (3) A crisis case where it immediately shows hotline info. The judge sees all three in under 90 seconds.
- **Our RESPONSIBLE_AI.md is the best one in the entire hackathon.** Not 2 paragraphs of "we care about ethics." A real document: what could go wrong, what we did about it, what we couldn't fix, and where the human must stay in control. Judges will read this. Make it undeniable.
- **The pitch video ends with a line that sticks.** "When it matters most, honesty is the safest answer." The judge remembers that sentence a week later when they're scoring.

## ⚪ LEVEL 3 — LEGENDARY

This is beyond winning. This is the project that becomes the example they show next year.

- **Someone in the real world could actually use this.** Not a polished demo with fake data. A working tool with real 211.org integration, real resource data for at least one city, and a path to actual deployment.
- **The architecture is clean enough to scale.** We build for one city, but the code doesn't hardcode "Austin, TX." Adding a new city = adding a new data source. The AI pipeline doesn't change. The frontend doesn't change. Plug and play.
- **Other hackathon teams reference our project as the standard for responsible AI.** They read our RESPONSIBLE_AI.md and use it as a template for their own projects. We don't just win Best Responsible AI — we define what it means.
- **USAII features ClearPath AI in their next boot camp** as an exemplar of the Community track. Our project becomes the case study.
- **The confidence calibration is mathematically sound, not vibes.** We don't just show a percentage — we can explain WHY it's 78% and not 82%. Temperature scaling, calibration curves, real methodology. A judge who knows AI looks at it and nods, not cringes.

## 🎯 DELIVERABLE QUALITY BARS

Every deliverable has a standard. These are not aspirational. These are what "done" looks like.

### Qualifier Answers (June 7–10)
- Every answer names a **specific user**, not "people"
- Every risk is a **real scenario** that could happen with OUR system
- Every mitigation is a **design decision we actually implemented**, not a promise
- The pitch sentence makes a stranger say "I get it"

### Pitch Video
- Under 3 minutes. No exceptions.
- Opens with the problem — not our names, not the tech
- Shows the app working, not a PowerPoint
- Ends with one memorable line
- Audio is clean. No background noise. No "um"

### GitHub Repository
- README.md with: problem, architecture diagram, setup instructions, live demo link, team info
- RESPONSIBLE_AI.md with: risks, mitigations, known limitations, human oversight protocol
- Clean folder structure. No files in root except README, CHARTER, LICENSE
- Commit history shows consistent work across the week, not 47 commits on June 21
- Every PR has a description

### Deployed Application
- Accessible 24/7 at a public URL
- Works on mobile (Chrome Android, Safari iOS)
- Works on slow connections (test with Chrome DevTools throttling)
- No console errors in production
- Loading state for every async operation
- Error state for every failure case
- Crisis detection works even if the AI server is down

### Devpost Submission
- Thumbnail image that looks professional
- One-paragraph description that a non-technical person understands
- "What it does" section with the 6-layer architecture clearly explained
- "How we built it" section naming every tool and why we chose it
- "Challenges we ran into" section that shows we actually struggled and solved problems
- "What we learned" section that's honest, not "we learned teamwork"
- "What's next" section that shows a real vision, not "add more features"
